My name is Steven Adeneye and I'm the founder of {Solved_by_Steve}. Since 2012 I've been fully immersed in the world of data analytics. From creating reports for sales analysis to writing code for IBM Watson, I have a cornucopia of diverse technical experience that I leverage to create unique solutions.

From 2010-2017 I was a highly decorated sales leader. Sales was good to me; I earned a plethora of electronics, awards, and even international trips. I was really good at sales, however, I was unfulfilled. I always gravitated to helping the SalesOps team gather data and create sales reports. My favorite sales memory involves more data analytics than sales strategy. The company that I worked for was launching an IPTV product (think AT&T U-Verse) but our marketing was delayed, meaning that sales calls would be scarce. Being the resourceful data sensei that I am, I quickly gathered customer data from our DOS-like CRM system. From there I extracted a list of customers that were in the service area of the new product; This resulted in my team making the first 20 sales of this product, 2 weeks before any other sales team. I may or may not have bragged about this to the CEO when I met him in Savannah at our sales conference.

In 2017 I decided to make a drastic change. The company that I worked for at the time offered an accelerator program that allowed me to learn about SEO at their expense. Because of this program I was able to transition into an SEO specialist role. If I'm honest, I kind of hated the idea that I was technically working for Google without the prestige or the fringe benefits. My perspective changed when I saw that my analysis of a competitor paired with the implementation of a FAQ schema led to a 30% increase in monthly traffic.It was at this point I realized that I should pursue a career centered around data.


I'm a senior data scientist who excels at data wrangling, machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualizations.

Etc, etc, etc
